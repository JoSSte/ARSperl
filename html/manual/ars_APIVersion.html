   <H2><CODE>$version = ars_APIVersion()</CODE></H2>

   This routine returns the "major" version of the API that 
   the ARSperl module was compiled against. For example, it 
   should return 2, 3, 4 etc. ARSperl doesn't work against pre-2.0
   libraries, so it shouldn't return anything less that 2.
